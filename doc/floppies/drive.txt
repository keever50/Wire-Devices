(R) Read only
(W) Write only
(R/W) Bi Directional. Read and write.

Hispeed:
	0: Contains floppy? (R) 
	1: Write Protection? (R)
	2: Lock(R/W) Locks the floppy in place. You dont have to set value but it prevents people from stealing your floppy. Usefull to prevent corruption.
	3: Force Eject(W) Ejects the floppy, so you dont have to do it yourself. Lazy, but cool.
	4: Motor(R/W) This should be turned on when operating a floppy. Turn it off when you dont want constant floppy noise.
	5: Sector(R/W) This will move the head and target to the inserted value. When bieng read, it will return it's current target.
	6: Read(W) Reads specific sector to buffer.
	7: Write(W) Writes buffer to specific sector.
	8: Status(R/W) Listed below.
	9: Error(R/W) Listed below. You can write this for custom errors and to set it back to 0. It wont reset itself.
	10: Reset(W) Sets every value to default.
	11: Sectors(R) How many sectors on the floppy?
	510: Device ID(R) Returns 100, which is standardized( in this pack ) for Floppy Drive.
	512-1024: Buffer(R/W) All values between are bieng written or are the result of a read operation. NOTE: This will be automatically erased on R/W operations.

Drive statuses:
	0 = off / not ready for operation.
	1 = no floppy.
	2 = ready. Also means the previous operation is finished.
	3 = busy.

Drive errors:
	0 = none ( its all ok. No need to worry )
	1 = forced floppy removal. ( floppy got physically removed or deleted )
	2 = motor not spinning. ( the motor has to be running before you use the floppy )
	3 = sector not found ( this usually means your sector is way over its limit or below 0 which shouln't make sense at first place. )

Drive speed:
Drive speed depends on where the sector is located.
This means when the sector is close to the center of the disk, it will take longer to move the head.
Tracks and cyclinders are not a wire option because it would make it too complex for wiremod. Wiremod is about fun and not giving headaches.
